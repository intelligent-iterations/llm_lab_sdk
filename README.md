# LLM Lab SDK

Intelligent Iterations Chat-bot SDK
This SDK allows you to integrate an Intelligent Iterations chat-bot into your application.

## Getting Started

# Log in or create an account at
- (- [LLM Lab](https://intelligentiterations.com))

# Create an API Key:
- Go to your account settings on the Intelligent Iterations website.
- Navigate to the API keys section and create a new API key.
- Keep your API key secure, as it will be used to authenticate your requests to the chat-bot
  service.

# Create an Agent:
- In your Intelligent Iterations account, create a new agent.
- Note down the ID of your newly created agent, as it will be used to specify the model.

# Integrate:
- Import the LLMLabSDK into your project.
- Initialize the class with your API key
- Specify the ID of the agent you created earlier. This will tell the SDK which agent to use
  for your interactions.
